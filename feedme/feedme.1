.SH NAME
feedme - event driven data sink client for the Unidata LDM
.SH "UNIX SYNOPSIS"
\fBfeedme \fR[\fB\-vx\fR] [\fB\-l \fIlogdest\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program gets selected meteorological data as it becomes available.
It is part of the Unidata Local Data Management system (LDM).
It calls  the LDM server at \fIremote\fR and requests
that data whose identifying key matches \fIpattern\fR be sent.
As data arrives at the server, qualifying data products are passed along
to this program. On receipt, this program writes the data to standard output.
If connection is lost to the server,
the program repeats its request for data.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 8
.B \-v
Verbose flag.  If present, the log will contain a line for 
each product that was received.
.TP 8
.B \-x
Requests that debugging information also be printed. Details about
each FEEDME RPC.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-h " remote"
Requests that  that the LDM server on \fIremote\fR send along data.
Default is "localhost".
.TP
.BI \-p " pattern"
Requests that data be sent along that matches \fIpattern\fP.
The default is `\fB.*\fP'.
.TP
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Requests that data that originates in a feed type of type 
\fIfeedtype\fP be sent along.
The default is any feed type.
.TP
.BI \-t " timeout"
Sets the RPC timeout on FEEDME requests to "\fItimeout\fR" seconds.
.TP
.BI \-T " TotalTimeo"
Give up attempting to make a connection after
\fITotalTimeo\fR seconds. Any partially built up client connnection
is destroyed and we start over.
.SH EXAMPLE
Although this program was written as a coding example, it is useful in
its own right.
The command
.RS +4
.nf
xterm -sb -title "Denver Warnings" -e ~ldm/bin/feedme -h myhost -f PPS -p "^W..... KDEN"
.fi
.RE
Will create a scrolling window titled "Denver Warnings" to which warnings
and watches from KDEN will be printed as they are received.
