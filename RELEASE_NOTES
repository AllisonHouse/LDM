Hi,

The main new feature of this minor release is the addition of a transitory
database of information on local upstream LDM processes. The database is
transitory because it only exists while an LDM server is running. The
information it contains on the upstream LDM processes is documented in the
manual-page for the associated new utility, uldbutil(1) (execute the command
"man uldbutil").

No similar database exists for downstream LDM processes because there is a
one-to-one correspondence between such processes and the REQUEST entries in the
LDM configuration-file, etc/ldmd.conf. If you want to know about locally-
executing upstream LDM processes, then just grep(1) the LDM configuration-file
(e.g., "grep -i ^request $HOME/etc/ldmd.conf").

The change-history of this package can be found in the file CHANGE_LOG in the
top-level source-directory.

The home-page for this package is <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm>.

This package is on GitHub at <https://github.com/Unidata/LDM>.

Regards,
Steve Emmerson
LDM Developer
