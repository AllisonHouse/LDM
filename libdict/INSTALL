There is no configure script. To build, just type 'make'. To install, type
'make install'. The Makefile is compatible with both GNU Make and BSD Make -
either will work. The default directory into which make install will put the
include files and the static and shared libraries is /usr/local. This may be
modified by editing Makefile and changing the value of the PREFIX variable to
the desired location.
