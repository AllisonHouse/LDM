- Eliminate the use of recursion in hb_tree, wb_tree, and pr_tree code where
  possible (almost everywhere thanks to parent ptrs).
- Add code for 'remove' operation on iterators.
- Add rot_rl() and rot_lr() which perform the same jobs as calling
  rot_right/left or rot_left/right, but optimize the operation.
- Maybe change the AVL tree to be configurable in terms of the balance factor
  k in HB[k], although from my own testing performance _always_ degenerates
  when relaxing this value.
- Top-down splay tree?
