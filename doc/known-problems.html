<h2><a name="futex">Hung downstream LDM on Linux system</a></h2>

<p>On some Linux systems, an <b><tt>ldmadmin stop</tt></b> command can
hang because a downstream LDM process hangs.
An <b><tt>strace(1)</tt></b> of the hung process indicates that it is
repeatedly invoking the <b><tt>futex</tt></b> system-call:
<blockquote><pre>
futex(0x583844, FUTEX_WAIT, 2, NULL)    = -1 EINTR (Interrupted system call)
--- SIGCONT (Continued) @ 0 (0) ---
futex(0x583844, FUTEX_WAIT, 2, NULL)    = -1 EINTR (Interrupted system call)
--- SIGCONT (Continued) @ 0 (0) ---
...
</blockquote></pre>
This is a known Linux bug.  Fixing it requires modifying either the Linux
kernel or the gcc runtime library or both.  The bug appears to exist in all
2.6 versions prior to and including version 2.6.13.  Further information
can be found by Googling "futex hang".

<p>A workaround appears to be to set the environment variable <tt><b>
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</b></tt> to <tt><b>2.4.19</b></tt> before executing any
LDM program.  For best effect, this should be done in the LDM user's 
profile-file.

<h2><a name="fcntl">Product-queue access hangs in Mac OS X 10
(Darwin 8 & 9)</a></h2>

<p>
The product-queue module, pq(3), makes repeated use of the fcntl(2)
system-function to lock portions of the product-queue.  This function
invokes the Mac OS X system-function fcntl$UNIX2003, which, for an
unknown reason, eventually hangs (i.e., never returns) if two or more
processes are accessing the product-queue.  This problem has been seen on
Mac OS X versions 10.5.0 and 10.5.2.

<p>
This bug was first reported to Apple on April 1, 2008.  There have been
only a few inquiries from Apple and no resolution to date.

<p>
There is no workaround.

<h2><a name="linux_time">Some data-products not processed or relayed</a></h2>

<p>
Processes that read the product-queue such as upstream LDM-s,
<tt><b>pqact</b>(1)</tt>, and <tt><b>pqcat</b>(1)</tt> can sometimes
miss a data-product that they should have, otherwise, selected and that
is actually in the queue if the system clock is not monotonic
(<i>i.e.</i> if the system clock sometimes jumps backwards).  This is
because the order in which products reside in the queue is the same
order as their <em>insertion-time</em> into the queue.  Consequently, a
backwards time-jump by the system clock can cause a newly-arrived data
product to <em>not</em> be inserted at the tail of the queue and,
consequently, be missed by a reader of the queue that's waiting at the
queue's tail for the next product.

<p>
Some Linux systems are particularly vulnerable to this phenomena.  They
are noted <a
href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1006086">here</a>.

<p>
The solution is to run the <tt><b>ntpd</b>(8)</tt> daemon to
continuously adjust the clock slew rate to ensure a monotonic system
clock.  Linux users are also <b>strongly advised</b> to follow <a
href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1006113">
this recommendation</a>.

<h2><a name="ntpdate_timeout"><tt><b>ldmadmin</b>(1)</tt> commands take a
long time to execute</a></h2>

In order to ensure that the system clock is accurate, most of the
<tt><b>ldmadmin</b>(1)</tt> commands also check the system clock via the
<tt><b>ntpdate</b>(1)</tt> utility, which contacts a remote timeserver.
In LDM version 6.8.0, the default timeout for that utility was 20
seconds and that value will still be used if you installed that version.
To ensure faster
response times, set the value of the variable
<tt><b>$ntpdate_timeout</b></tt> in the <tt><b>ldmadmin</b>(1)</tt> 
configuration-file, <tt><b>etc/ldmadmin-pl.conf</b></tt>,
to a smaller number of seconds (<i>e.g.</i>, 5).
