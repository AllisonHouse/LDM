This package contains the HTML documentation for the Unidata Program
Center's Local Data Manager (LDM).

The release-identifier of this package has the following form:

    ldm-<major>.<minor>.<rev>

where:

    <major>	Is the major release-number (e.g., 6).  This component
		tracks the major release number of the source distribution.

    <minor>	Is the minor release-number (e.g., 1).  This component
		tracks the minor release number of the source distribution.

    <rev>	Is the revision-level of the documentation (e.g., B).
		This component does NOT track the revision-level of the 
		source distribution.

Because the online version of the documentation is likely to be more
up-to-date than any downloaded version, we strongly recommend that you
use the online version rather than a downloaded version.

The online documentation is available at

    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm

under the appropriate release-identifier.
