<h1 align="center">FT19/NOGAPS/FNMOC Feedtype</h1><br>

<p align="justify">Feedtype FT19 is currently allocated to FNMOC's Global Ocean Data Assimilation 
  Experiment <a href="http://usgodae3.fnmoc.navy.mil/"> <b>(GODAE)</b></a> 
  server. This feedtype also has the alias "NOGAPS". Additionally, the newly introduced 
  alias "FNMOC", is available in LDM version 5.1.4 or greater. This latter alias 
  was introduced as we became aware that FNMOC would be providing more than one 
  data stream. </p>
<p align="justify"> FNMOC currently provides two data streams via Unidata's Internet Data Distribution 
  (IDD) network under the FNMOC feedtype: the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric 
  Prediction System <a href="http://www.usgodae.fnmoc.navy.mil/cgi-bin/datalist.pl?generate=summary"> 
  <b>(NOGAPS)</b></a> stream and the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction

Below are some example pqact.conf entries showing showing patterns that specify this data and
differentiate the two streams.  Although both product IDs start with
US058, the NOGAPS data uses model ID 0058, while the COAMPS models are
0027, 0041, 0060, 0083, and 0082.  Note that the second pattern simply
files any non-0058 model as COAMPS data.
