<h1 align="center">LDM 6.8 Release Notes</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
    Installation:
    <ul>
	<li>
	The ldmadmin(1) configuration-file is copied, read, and
	rewritten with additional user-configurable parameters.
    </ul>

    <li>
    LDM Server (rpc.ldmd):
    <ul>
	<li>
	Improved vetting (i.e., access-checking) of a client to
	prevent delays due to a time-out on the reverse DNS lookup,
	which is used to convert the client IP address into a
	hostname:
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    Moved vetting from the LDM server before fork(2)ing a
	    child process to the fork(2)ed child process.

	    <li>
	    Made vetting a two-phase procedure: first with the
	    client IP address and then, if and only if that fails,
	    with the client hostname.
	</ul>

	<li>
	Added the new option "-M max_clients" (default: 256).
    </ul>

    <li>
    ldmadmin(1):
    <ul>
	<li>
	Program:
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    Added the ability to check the accuracy of the system
	    clock.  This new ability is highly user-configurable.
	    The defaults are to check the clock but not to abort if
	    it's off by too much.

	    <li>
	    Added removal of product-information (~/.*.info) files
	    to the "delqueue" command if "$deleteInfoFiles" is true
	    in the ldmadmin(1) configuration-file.

	    <li>
	    Added the new option "-M max_clients".

	    <li>
	    Added the new commands "printmetrics", "addmetrics", and
	    "plotmetrics".

	    <li>
	    Moved variables "$os" and "$release" to the
	    configuration-file.

	    <li>
	    Added the error message "Uknown command: ".

	    <li>
	    Removed printing of "ldmadmin" from "ldmadmin usage" output.
	</ul>

	<li>
	Configuration-file (ldmadmin-pl.conf):
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    Improved internal documentation and layout.

	    <li>
	    Added many new variables.
	</ul>

	<li>
	Manual-Page:
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    Documented LDM configuration-file argument.

	    <li>
	    Added "-C" and "-x" options.

	    <li>
	    Rearranged options alphabetically.
	</ul>

    <li>
    scour(1):
	Added the prefix "scour: " to log messages.

    <li>
    scripts/plotMetrics:
	Created this script for plotting the accumulated output of
	"ldmadmin addmetrics".
</ul>
