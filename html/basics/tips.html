<h1 align="center"><a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> Tips</h1>

<p>This webpage contains "best practice" advice on the LDM.

<ul>
<li>
Have a product-queue sufficiently large that the age of the oldest 
product is greater than the "from" time of any FEEDME request.

<li>
Have sufficient physical memory on the LDM computer to allow the
product-queue to be completely contained in memory.

<li>
Try to do your local processing of data-products by <tt>pqact</tt> on a
computer that's not relaying data.

<li>
Consider splitting a large-volume REQUEST entry in the LDM 
configuration-file,
<a href="glindex.html#ldmd.conf"><tt>ldmd.conf</tt></a>,
into multiple, smaller, disjoint entries.
