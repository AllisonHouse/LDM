<h1 align="center">Running Multiple LDM-s</h1>       

<p>
It's possible to run multiple instances of an
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
system on a single computer.  
This article explains how and leaves the "why" to the reader.

<p>
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the installation and
configuration procedures for an 
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
system.
For each
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
system that you want to execute, build and install an 
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
package
with the following modifications:

<ol>
    <li>Choose a distinct user-account with its own name (e.g., 
	<code>ldm2</code>) and home directory (e.g., <code>/local/ldm2</code>).

    <li>Choose a distinct logging facility to use (e.g., <code>local2</code>)
	and modify the <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> file appropriately.

    <li>When executing the configure(1) script, use the 
	<code>--enable-logging=<a href="glindex.html#localn">local<i>n</i></a>
	to set the logging facility.

    <li>Decide on one of the following approaches for allowing connections
	from downstream sites:

    <ul>

	<li>Decide on a distinct IP address to use.  This necessitates the use
	of a distinct network interface, which could be a real one (implemented
	in hardware) or a virtual one (implemented in software).  When
	configuring the <a
	href="glindex.html#ldmadmin"><code>ldmadmin(1)</code></a>
	configuration-file, <a href="glindex.html#ldmadmin-pl.conf">
	<code>etc/ldmadmin-pl.conf</code></a>, use the <code>$ip_addr</code>
	variable to specify that IP address.

	<li>Select a distinct port on which the LDM server will listen. Use
	the "--enable-port=port" option of the configure script to
	configure the LDM to use that port. On the downstream hosts, do
	one of the following:

	<ul>

	    <li>Use the optional ":port" field in REQUEST entries to
	    specify to which port to connect.

	    <li>Configure the downstream LDM to use the same port via
	    the same "--enable-port=port" option of the
	    configure script.  This approach is recursive: further
	    downstream sites will also need to be modified.

	</ul>

    </ul>

</ol>
