How to activate your LDM system.
</div>

<p>Once the LDM system is installed and configured, activating it 
takes only a few steps.
See 
<a href="../basics/activating.html">
LDM Reference: Activating the LDM Installation</a> for instructions.

<p>You should view the LDM logfile, <tt>$LDMHOME/logs/ldmd.log</tt>,
to see what a successful activation looks like.  Information on
interpreting the LDM logfile can be found at
