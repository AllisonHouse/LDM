<hr>
<p>A note from NMC this morning informs us that the demise of the 2.5 x 5.0 deg. 
  aviation global model products from the HRS datastream (product IDs matching 
  <tt>"^H.[A-D]... KWBC ...... /mAVN"</tt>) has been postponed to 5 June 1995 
  from the previously announced date of 18 April 1995. For your information, <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/gempak/README/thin.grid">here</a> 
  is a compilation of the email thread about the thinned grid issue. </p><br>
<h3>Wed Apr 5 1995</h3>

Users who are saving the aviation global model 1.25 x 1.25 degree (WAFS)
products on the "thinned grid" from the HRS datastream (product IDs matching
<tt>"^H.[I-P].* /mAVN"</tt>) will have to change their pattern-action
entries in the pqact.conf configuration file after 12Z on 11 April 1995 to
allow for either <tt>"/mAVN"</tt> or <tt>"/mSSIAVN"</tt> in the product ID,
as the result of a change announced today:

<pre>
    NOUS40 KWBC 051512
    FOS NOTICE NO 657 04-05-95
    **************************NOTICE******************************
    HRS SUBSCRIBERS

	 AT 12Z ON 11 APRIL... THE PRODUCTION OF THE AVIATION
    1.25X1.25 (WAFS) PRODUCTS WILL BE MOVED FROM THE HDS COMPUTERS TO
    THE CRAY COMPUTERS.  THE TIME OF CREATION AND TRANSMISSION TO THE
    NWSTG SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME... PERHAPS EVEN
    BETTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

	 THERE WILL BE ONE SLIGHT CHANGE WITH THIS PROCESSING.  OCTET
    6 OF THE PRODUCT DEFINITION SECTION (PDS) FOR THE 00HR PRODUCTS
    WILL BE CHANGED FROM 77 (4D HEX) TO 81 (51 HEX).  THIS CORRECTLY
    REFLECTS THAT THE ANALYSIS/00HR PRODUCTS ARE GENERATED BY THE
    SPECTRAL STATISTICAL INTERPOLATION (SSI) MODEL.  IT IS SUGGESTED
    THAT USERS BE FLEXIBLE AND ALLOW FOR '77' OR '81' IN THEIR CODES.
    THIS WILL PROTECT EVERYONE IN THE EVENT THAT THIS CHANGE HAS TO
    BE POSTPONED OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE HDS VERSION IS USED FOR
    BACKUP PURPOSES.
</pre>

As an example, a pqact.conf entry such as the following:
<pre>
    # File "thinned grid" products
    #
    HRS     ^H.[I-P]... KWBC ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*/mAVN
	    FILE    data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_avn.wmo
</pre>

would have to be changed to something like:
<pre>
    # File "thinned grid" products
    #
    HRS     ^H.[I-P]... KWBC ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*(/mAVN|/mSSIAVN)
	    FILE    data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_avn.wmo
</pre>
<br>

<p>indicates that the aviation global model products from the HRS datastream on 
  2.5 x 5.0 deg. lat/lon grids (product IDs matching <tt>"^H.[A-D]... KWBC ...... 
  /mAVN"</tt>) will disappear from the HRS datastream on 18 April 1995. The UPC 
  is working on providing decoding of the "thinned grid" versions of these products 
  onto a regular lat/lon grid for use in applications. More information will be 
  available soon. <em>[Note: the April 18 date was later postponed to 5 June.]</em> 
</p><br>
<h3>Fri Mar 10 1995</h3>

<p>Information about the online Winter '95 LDM Workshop presentations is now available 
  to WWW browsers from the <a
href="index.html"> LDM homepage</a>. These online presentations have been updated 
  from the Fall '94 LDM Workshop. </p><br>
<h3>Thu Feb 16 1995</h3>

Today, some new products began appearing on the HRS data stream: the AVN
and NGM model outputs on the `211' grid (also used by the ETA and RUC
models).  This makes it possible to compare all the model forecasts on the
same grid.  All four models use the same WMO headers, however, so it's more
important than ever to distinguish among them with the /m model field
appended to the WMO header in the product ID, since now a WMO header such as
"YTQB50" could refer to data from any of the AVN, ETA, NGM, or RUC models.
<p>
As a reminder, here are example entries for the pqact.conf file to file 
ETA and RUC products:
<pre>
#
# File raw GRIB messages corresponding to ETA model on the Q (211) grid
#
HRS     ^[YZ].Q... KWBC ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*/mETA
        FILE    data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_eta.wmo

#
# File raw GRIB messages corresponding to RUC model on the Q (211) grid
#
HRS     ^[YZ].Q... KWBC ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*/mRUC
        FILE    data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_ruc.wmo
</pre>
<br>
<h3>Wed 9 Feb 1995</h3>

<p>There is now an HTML version of the RUC Technical Procedures Bulletin (NWS 
  TPB #416, September 27, 1994) including the figures available in the published 
  bulletin. This document describes the Rapid Update Cycle products that have 
  been added to the HRS data stream.</p>
<br>
<h3>Fri 3 Feb 1995</h3>

<p>A problem was reported with the ulog library in the LDM 4.1.38 release on HPUX 
  platforms. A fix has been developed for the problem, and new HPUX binaries are 
  now available. For more details or for the patch necessary for the source, see 
  the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/ldm/ulog-bug.txt">text 
  of the message</a> on this problem from Glenn Davis. </p><br>
<h3>Wed 11 Jan 1995</h3>

A maintenance release, LDM 4.1.38, was made available today. An announcement of 
the release sent to the ldm-users mailing list describes the most important changes, 
enhancements, and bug fixes. 
<p>

The software, in both source code and binary distributions, is available
from the Unidata anonymous FTP server.  Binary releases are available for
the following operating systems:

<ul>
  <li> SunOS 4.1.3
  <li> Solaris 2.3
  <li> IRIX 5.2
  <li> OSF/1 3.0
  <li> AIX 3.2
  <li> HP-UX 9.05
</ul>

<p>The release announcement includes additional information, and more details 
  are available in the documentation accompanying the software. </p><br>
<h3>Fri 6 Jan 1995</h3>

It was announced today that effective January 25 1995 the remaining RUC
(00Z, 03Z, 09Z, and 12Z) products will be added to the High Resolution data
Service (HRS).  Currently only the 6-hour forecasts are being broadcast in
the HRS data stream.  Thus the volume of RUC data on HRS for each run (every
3 hours) will increase from about 0.83 Mbytes in 123 products to about 4.2
Mbytes in 615 products. <p>

We're testing LDM 4.1.38 on local platforms and revising the Site Manager's
Guide for a new release (probably next Wednesday).  The new release will
incorporate the following features and fixes (more detail will be provided
in the RELEASE_NOTES accompanying the release):

<ul>
  <li> Updated default baud rates for pqing, to reflect the new
       Ku-band rates for the Family of Services (9.6 Kbps for DDS, PPS, and
       IDS, 19.2 Kbps for HRS and DDPLUS);
  <li> Changed <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?pqing+1">pqing</a> to append a
       model indicator to the product identifier for HRS products to
       disambiguate products with the same WMO header from different models;
  <li> Changed ldmadmin default to recreate product queue whenever LDM
       system starts, instead of using old queue.
  <li> Changed default compilation flags so compatibility with Neilley's
       weather program will now be the default (DBFILE appends rather than
       overwriting).
  <li> Ported to Intel/BSDI platform.
  <li> Isolated use of LOCAL0 facility for syslogd so it's easy to change,
       to avoid conflicts with other packages' use of LOCAL0.
  <li> Included a new feed statistics monitor, ldmprods.
  <li> Added raction utility for pqact to invoke actions on remote hosts
       with error messages going to local log file.
  <li> Fixed bug in pqact dates near end-of-month due to use of local_time
       instead of gmtime.
  <li> Enhanced ldmadmin to make `stop' action work better.
  <li> Changed mailpqstats to send information for feed routing topology.
  <li> Added ldmadmin support for setting PATH in ldmadmin.conf so
       decoders can be found even when installed in wierd places.
  <li> Added ldmadmin `-f feedpat' option to `watch' action.
  <li> Added `-f' (force portmapper unregistration) option to rpc.ldmd so it
       will start even if previous rpc.ldmd is still registered with portmapper.
  <li> Fixed sample pqact configuration file to make it easier to uncomment desired
       pattern/action lines.
  <li> Revised Site Manager's Guide and various man documents.

<h3>Wed 4 Jan 1995</h3>

<p>WSI has made available via the World Wide Web a NEXRAD site maintenance utility 
  for all current WSI/UNIDATA NEXRAD customers. For more details, see the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/ldm/wsi.html">WSI 
  announcement</a> of the NEXRAD utility or the new <a href="http://www.uni.wsicorp.com">WSI

<h3>16 Dec 1994</h3>

<p>A PostScript version of the RUC Technical Procedures Bulletin (NWS TPB #416, 
  September 27, 1994, sans figures for now) describing the Rapid Update Cycle 
  products beginning to appear on the HRS data stream is now available.</p>
<br>

<h3>12 Dec 1994</h3>

<p>Alden said they have improved the way they are generating the DIFAX products 
  announced last week, so users should see improvements in the quality of the 
  resulting images. </p><br>
<h3>9 Dec 1994</h3>

Peggy Bruehl posted more information on dealing with the new HRS RUC
products that have identical headers to ETA products.  Here's an example of
pqact.conf entries that distinguish between the ETA and RUC model outputs,
using the new model identifier information:

<pre>
#
# File raw GRIB messages corresponding to ETA 
#
HRS     ^[YZ].Q... KWBC ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*/mETA
        FILE    data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_eta.wmo

#
# File raw GRIB messages corresponding to RUC
#
HRS     ^[YZ].Q... KWBC ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*/mRUC
        FILE    data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_ruc.wmo
</pre><br>

<h3>8 Dec 1994</h3>

We learned today that the problems we recently saw with identical WMO
headers for products from different models (the RUC and ETA models) will get
worse in February when the RGL and AVN MARD grids (206 and 209) are
converted to the 211 grid.  Then there will be four models with the same WMO
headers.

<p> We installed a new version of <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?pqing+1">pqing</a> at Alden that appends a model
identifier to the product identifiers for HRS GRIB products injected into
the IDD.  This permits sites to disambiguate between RUC and ETA model data
that now use identical WMO headers.  The new version of pqing adds "/mXXX"
to the product identifier for IDD HRS products, where "XXX" is an
abbreviation for the model.

<p>
The tags added to the HRS GRIB products by the new ingester are:
<pre>
 10	/mNOW	Global Wind-Wave Forecast Model
 25	/mSNO	Snow Cover Analysis
 39	/mNGM	Nested Grid Forecast Model
 44	/mSST	Sea Surface Temperature Analysis
 64	/mROI	Regional Optimal Interpolation Analysis
 77	/mAVN	126 wave triangular, 28 layer Spectral Model
			 from Aviation Run
 78	/mMRF	126 wave triangular, 28 layer Spectral Model
			from Medium Range Forecast Run
 83	/mETA	ETA Model - 80 km version
 86	/mRUC	RUC/MAPS Model
 88	/mPWAV	Ocean Wave model with additional physics
121	/mECMF	Something from ECMWF...
122	/m122   Newer ECMWF model
</pre>

<h3>7 Dec 1994</h3>

<p>Alden announces the distribution of the National Weather Service DIFAX service 
  via the Internet. If you are interested in subscribing to this service please 
  let Alden know by addressing your messages to "arbettere@alden.com" or by calling 
  Edie Arbetter at 508-366-8851 extension 2258. We're now able to convert the 
  new G3 format DIFAX products from Alden to GIF and PostScript files for viewing 
  or printing. An active mailing list, difax at unidata.ucar.edu, is exploring the 
  best way to do this. More information on the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/idd/difax.html">DIFAX 
  products</a>. </p><br>
<h3>5 Dec 1994</h3>

<p>Steve Emmerson and Tom Yoksas have managed to get a special OS/2 LDM module 
  running that enables an OS/2 system to capture the McIDAS data from an upstream 
  site that is relaying the data using the LDM. With this OS/2 module, there is 
  no need for the upstream node to run any special software other than the LDM. 
  Currently the module only runs on OS/2 systems with the IBM TCP/IP package. 
  We are working with FTP, Inc. to get an upgrade to their package so the module 
  will run with their software as well. In the meantime OS/2 sites using FTP, 
  Inc.software continue to be fed reliably using mctingest. </p><br>
<h3>1 Dec 1994</h3>

<p align="justify">Scheduled date for termination of the Alden C Band broadcast. 
  Alden extends the C-Band broadcast for a few more weeks, giving sites some extra 
  time to switch to getting their data via the <a href="/software/idd/index.html">IDD</a> 
  or Ku-Band broadcast. </p>
<p align="justify"> Accelerated deployment of the IDD using LDM 4.1 has been going on during
the month of November.  For a chronicle of this effort, see the <a
href="/software/idd/whatsnew.html">IDD What's
New</a> document.  62 university sites that we know of are now running the
LDM 4.1 software.

</p>
<p>Harry Edmon contributed a fix for the gribtogem and gribtonc decoders that 
  permitted them to decode the new HRS RUC products. The fix turns out to be a 
  mixed blessing, because the RUC model output grids are the same used for the 
  ETA model, so the RUC grids overwrite ETA grids in decoded files produced by 
  gribtogem and gribtonc. </p><br>
<h3>30 Nov 1994</h3>

<p>We began seeing Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) products appear for 6-hour forecasts 
  on the HRS data stream. Some of them have identical WMO headers to ETA products. 
  The gribtogem and gribtonc decoders are both exiting when trying to decode these 
  products. </p><br>
<h3>Nov 29, 1994</h3>

Robb Kambic released a new version of the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mailpqstats+1">mailpqstats</a> 
script for sending statistics collected from an LDM product queue to the UPC for 
processing with other IDD statistics to produce <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/idd/status/ldmstats.nodes">hourly</a> 
and daily reports. 
<p>

We added an HTML document on LDM Product Streams to the <a
href="index.html">LDM Home Page</a> and from that a HTML document on the <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/ldm/hds.html">HDS data stream</a>.  As time allows we will fill in similar
information on other data streams.
</p>
<p>We created the mailing list alias "hrs at unidata.ucar.edu" for the
old hds at unidata.ucar.edu 
  mailing list, since the HDS data stream has been renamed HRS for about a year. 
</p><br>
<h3>18 Nov 1994</h3>

<p>Robb Kambic released a new perl script, ldmprods, that displays local product 
  statistics in one minute intervals. This can make it easier for a site administrator 
  to monitor LDM performance and catch problems early. </p>
<br>
<h3>17 Nov 1994</h3>

<p>Mitch Baltuch released the first version of IDD monitor software, a Motif v1.2-based 
  application that provides an interactive monitoring facility for nodes on the 
  Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system. It is designed to provide visual and 
  audible cues when LDM servers on specified IDD nodes are not responding. </p>
<br>
<h3>12 Nov 1994</h3>

<p>We discovered an incorrect recommendation in the LDM documentation that was 
  leading some sites to put in crontab entries that mailed in statistics reports 
  at 5 minutes past the hour. The optimum time for mailing in the reports is 35 
  minutes after the hour. </p><br>
<h3>1 Nov 1994</h3>
