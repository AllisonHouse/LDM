<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the 2010 Training Workshop on the Unidata LDM!

<p>Your instructor is Steve Emmerson, co-developer of
LDM 4, developer of LDM 6, and author of this workshop.

<p>When you finish this class, you should be able to install, configure,
and manage an LDM system or network of LDM systems at your home site.
You might even do that remotely during the class itself.

We'll probably be done by noon of the second day, which means we'll
have time to examine the LDM installation at your site and upgrade it
if you wish.

<h2><a name="tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h2>

<p>Because the LDM is designed to run on many different flavors of UNIX and because
each site will probably use the LDM in different ways,
the LDM Tutorial is designed to be a general tutorial -- covering all aspects
of the LDM while omitting operating-system-specific and site-specific details.
As a consequence, the tutorial must be
customized to reflect the specific circumstances of this workshop.
This is done by embedding hyperlinks like the following
in the tutorial at appropriate locations:
<blockquote>
<a href="specifics.html">Workshop-specific instructions</a>
</blockquote>
Please follow these hyperlinks when appropriate.

<p>And now, the general <a href="../tutorial/index.html">
LDM Tutorial</a>.
