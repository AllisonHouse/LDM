<h1 align="center">LDM 6.9.0.2 Release Notes</h1>
<ul>
    <li>SUMMARY:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Dragged the kicking and screaming LDM package into the late
            20th century.  :-)
        </ul>

    <li>Installation:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Upgraded the package-installation mechanism from one based on
            <tt>autoconf(1)</tt> and ad-hoc makefiles to one based on
            automake(1).  <b>THIS IS A BIG DEAL WITH RAMIFICATIONS: BOTH THE
            INSTALLATION PROCEDURE AND INSTALLATION LAYOUT ARE DIFFERENT.
            FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT INSTALLING THE LDM AND FOLLOW THE
            NEW WEB-PAGE INSTRUCTIONS.</b>

            <li>
            Incorporated documentation into the package.
        </ul>

    <li>LDM (<tt>ldmd(1)</tt>):
        <ul>
            <li>
            Renamed the LDM server from <tt>rpc.ldmd</tt> to just <tt>ldmd</tt>.

            <li>
            Added logging to some failed <tt>pq_close()</tt> calls in an
            attempt to debug the Mac OS X 10.5 <tt>fcntl()</tt> problem.
        </ul>

    <li><tt>ldmadmin(1)</tt>:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Added the command <tt>vetqueuesize</tt> to reconcile the maximum
            latency parameter with the observed minimum virtual residence time
            of the queue.

            <li>
            Added the command <tt>check</tt> to check the LDM system via
            <tt>crontab(1)
            </tt>.
        </ul>

    <li>Registry:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Created a registry for the LDM similar to the Windows registry,
            Gnome's GCONF, and Java's preferences.  The registry can be
            accessed both from scripts and programatically.

            <li><tt>regutil(1)</tt>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    New utility for accessing the LDM registry from the
                    command-line.
                </ul>

            <li>
            The registry is implemented as an XML file (etc/registry.xml).

            <li>
            As a consequence of the creation and use of the registry
                <ul>
                    <li>The environment variables
                    LDMHOSTNAME and LDMPQFNAME are now defunct.

                    <li><b>The <tt>ldmadmin(1)</tt> configuration-file, <tt>
                    etc/ldmadmin-pl.conf</tt> is now defunct</b> (although,
                    it is mined for configuration parmeters during the
                    installation process, if it exists).
                </ul>
        </ul>

    <li>Portability:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Added checks for <tt>netstat(1)</tt> and <tt>top(1)</tt> to
            configure(1) script and appropriately modified ldmadmin(1).  Among
            other things, this ported the <tt>ldmadmin printmetrics</tt>
            command to Mac OS X (note, however, that a bug in Mac OS X prevents
            the LDM from working reliably on that system).
        </ul>

    <li><tt>pqmon(1)</tt>:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Added <tt>-S</tt> option to print various size parameters to the 
            standard output stream.
        </ul>

    <li><tt>pqutil(1)</tt>:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Added <tt>-C</tt> option to clear the minimum virtual residence time
            metric.
        </ul>

    <li><tt>ulogger(1)</tt>:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Made the LDM logging facility (default: <tt>LOG_LOCAL0</tt>) the
            default facility for the <tt>-p</tt> option.
        </ul>

    <li>pq(3) library:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Corrected ability to build without <tt>mmap(2)</tt> support via the
            NO_MMAP C macro.

            <li>
            Added the ability to track the minimum virtual residence time.
        </ul>

    <li><tt>ldmsend(1)</tt>:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Modified <tt>ldmsend(1)</tt> to ensure that it can send a
            zero-length file on any system.
        </ul>

    <li>Misc:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Corrected <tt>pat_clone()</tt> if the source is the trivial pattern
            <tt>.*</tt>.

            <li>
	    Upgraded the version-control mechanism from CVS to <tt>git(1)</tt>.

            <li>
	    Upgraded the package-installation mechanism from ad-hoc makefiles
            to <tt>automake(1)</tt>.

            <li>
            Corrected <tt>FNEXRAD</tt> webpages: removed "floater" link and
            corrected "how to" link.

            <li>
            Replaced defunct hyperlinks to list of WMO headers with hyperlink
            to WMO Tables from Manual 386.
        </ul>
</ul>
