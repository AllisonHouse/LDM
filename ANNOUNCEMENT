Dear LDM user,

Version 6.8 of the LDM is now available from the LDM homepage at
    <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/>
or from
    <ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/ldm/ldm-6.8.0.tar.gz>

This version features the following changes:

  1)  The package now users the GNU automake(1) package-installation
      system.  Besides making my life easier (by simplifying LDM
      development), this has the following consequences for you:

      1.1)  The manual-pages will appear to be be installed in
            $HOME/share/man instead of $HOME/man.  Consequently, you
            will have to modify the LDM user's MANPATH environment
            variable.

      1.2)  The HTML documentation that was previously available only
            on-line will now appear to be installed under
            $HOME/share/doc.

More information can be found in the file RELEASE_NOTES in the top-level
source-directory.

For an extensive history of changes to the LDM, see the file CHANGE_LOG
in the top-level source-directory.

As always, we are happy to install the LDM system for you if you grant
us root access to your system.

Regards,
Steve Emmerson
LDM Developer
