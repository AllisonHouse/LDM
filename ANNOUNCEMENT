Dear LDM user,

Version 6.8 of the LDM is now available from the LDM homepage at
    <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/>
or from
    <ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/ldm/ldm-6.8.0.tar.gz>

This version features the following:

    1)  The way the top-level LDM server vets new client connections is
	improved;
    2)  More information is printed by the "ldmadmin config"
	command;
    3)  The accuracy of the system clock can be checked by
	ldmadmin(1); and
    4)  LDM performance metrics can now be collected and plotted by the
	ldmadmin(1) script if the requisite utilities are installed.

More information can be found in the file RELEASE_NOTES in the top-level
source-directory.

For an extensive history of changes to the LDM, see the file CHANGE_LOG
in the top-level source-directory.

As always, we are happy to install the LDM system for you if you grant
us root access to your system.

Regards,
Steve Emmerson
LDM Developer
