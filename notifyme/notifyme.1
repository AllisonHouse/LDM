.SH DESCRIPTION
This program receives notification messages from the 
Unidata Local Data Management system (ldm) and optionally
prints the notification information with timestamps.
It establishes a connection with the LDM server at \fIremote\fR and requests
notification of the arrival data whose identifier matches \fIpattern\fR.
As data arrives at the server,  notification is sent to this program.
.LP
This program is an example of how to use ldm4 notification.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 8
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Requests that notification of data that originates in a feed type of type 
\fIfeedtype\fP be sent along.
The default is `ANY'.
.TP
.BI \-h " remote"
Requests notification from the ldm server on \fIremote\fR. Default
is "localhost".
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-o " offset"
Requests notification for data that arrived \fIoffset\fP seconds before NOW.
The default is 0.
.TP
.BI \-p " pattern"
Requests that notification of data be sent along that matches \fIpattern\fP.
The default is `\fB.*\fP'.
.TP
.BI \-T " TotalTimeo"
Give up attempting to make a connection after
\fITotalTimeo\fR seconds. Any partially built up client connnection
is destroyed and we start over.
.TP
.BI \-t " timeout"
Sets the RPC timeout on FEEDME requests to \fItimeout\fR seconds.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose flag.  If present, the log will contain a line for 
each product that was received. Each line reports (1) the current system time, 
(2) the string 'notifyme', (3) the product size, (4) the time the product 
was injected into the IDD, (5) the feed type, (6) a sequence number, and 
(7) the product ID with the actual product time. (If you take the difference 
between the first and fourth fields, you can see how long it took the product 
to arrive at the host.)
.TP
.BI \-x
Requests that debugging information also be printed.
.TP
.B -y
Use logging timestamps with microsecond resolution. The default is
second resolution.
.TP
.B -z
Use logging timestamps formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard
(e.g.
.IR YYYYMMDD T hhmmss ).
The default is
.IR Mon\ day\ hh : mm : ss
.SH EXAMPLE
The command
.RS +4
.nf
notifyme -v
.fi
.RE
will let you watch the data come in to the local host.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ldmd(1), ldmd.conf(5), feedme(1) 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages and log messages are written to the
log file. 
.SH BUGS and LIMITATIONS
While this is the most important diagnostic tool in the LDM package, if
you leave off the -v flag, you won't see much.
