.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program is an example of how to send data using ldm protocols.
Its primary function is as a coding example. It may also be used to
test the ldm server.  It might also be useful to resend data
after a downstream node has been offline. For most applications,
the use of this program is deprecated in favor of \fBpqinsert(1)\fR.
.LP
The program sends each file given on the command line as a separate
ldm data product to the ldm server on \fBremote\fR. The file name is
used as product identifier.
The product feed type is specified by the \fB\-f\fR option.
The current time is used as product timestamp.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 8
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Asserts that the data being send has feed type \fIfeedtype\fR.
The default is `EXP', indicating an experimental feedtype.
.TP
.BI \-h " remote"
Sends data to the ldm server on \fIremote\fR. The default is `localhost'.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-P " port"
The port on the remote sytem to which to connect.  Only useful for LDM 6
protocols.  The well-known LDM port is 388.
.TP
.BI \-s " seqno"
Sets the product sequence number associated with the first product
to \fIseqno\fR. Subsequent products (files on the command line)
are numbered sequentially. Defaults to zero.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose flag.  If present, the log will contain a line for 
each product file that was sent.
.TP
.BI \-x
Requests that debugging information also be printed.
.SH EXAMPLE
The command
.RS +4
.nf
ldmsend -v -h otherhost -f MCIDAS 92010100.are
.fi
.RE
will ship the file `92010100.are' to `otherhost' with feedtype `MCIDAS'.
The ldm server on `otherhost'
should be configured to do something with a McIDAS product whose identifier is
`92010100.are'.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
pqinsert(1), ldmd(1), ldmd.conf(5)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages and log messages are written to the log file.
