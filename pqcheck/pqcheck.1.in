.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program checks that a product-queue is not open for writing by any
process.  Beginning with this version of the LDM, a product-queue contains
a persistent "write count".  Every time 
\fBpq_open\fP(3) is invoked on a product-queue with the
\fBPQ_READONLY\fP flag unset, the write-count is incremented.
Every time 
\fBpq_close\fP(3) is invoked on a product-queue opened in this way,
the write-count is decremented.
.LP
If it is known that no process holds the product-queue open for writing
and this utility indicates that the product-queue write-count is zero, then the
product-queue was successfully closed by all processes that had it open for
writing and the product-queue is guaranteed to be in a consistent state 
(i.e., the product-queue will not be corrupt).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -F
Force.  Support for a write-count will be added to the product-queue,
if necessary, and the write-count will be set to zero.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI "-q " pqfname
The filename of the product queue.
The default is
.nh
\fB$(regutil regpath{QUEUE_PATH})\fP.
.hy
.TP
.B -v
Verbose logging.  The write-count for the product-queue will be printed.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGTERM
Normal termination.
.TP
.BR SIGINT
Immediate termination.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
Success.  The product-queue was opened and the write-count is zero.
.TP
1
A system-error occurred.  
.TP
2
The product-queue doesn't have a write-count.  If you know that no process
has the product-queue open for writing, then you can use the \fB-F\fP option
to add write-count capability to the product-queue.
.TP
3
The product-queue was opened but the write-count is positive.
.TP
4
The product-queue could not be opened because it is internally inconsistent.
It will have to be deleted and recreated.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
The following shell-script fragment checks the product-queue:
.RS +4
.nf
#
# The product-queue exists.  Test for corruption.
#
if pqcheck -q $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq; then
    echo "Using existing queue."
else
    case $? in
    1)  echo "Aborting..."
        ;;
    2)  echo "Adding write-count capability to product-queue"
        if ! pqcheck -F -q $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq; then
            echo "Aborting..."
        fi
        ;;
    3)  echo "Product-queue incorrectly closed.  Checking..."
        if pqcat -s -l /dev/null; then
            echo "Product-queue appears OK.  Clearing write-count."
            if ! pqcheck -F -q $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq; then
                echo "Aborting..."
            fi
        else
            echo "Product-queue appears corrupt.  Recreating..."
            /bin/mv -f $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq.save
            /bin/su - ldm -c "$LDMBIN/ldmadmin delqueue"
            /bin/su - ldm -c "$LDMBIN/ldmadmin mkqueue"
        fi
        ;;
    4)  echo "Product-queue is corrupt.  Recreating..."
            /bin/mv -f $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq $LDMHOME/data/ldm.pq.save
            /bin/su - ldm -c "$LDMBIN/ldmadmin delqueue"

This fragment
is appropriate for a shell-script that starts the LDM system at boot-time.
